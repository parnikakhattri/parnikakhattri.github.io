# Parnika Khattri

Hi, I'm Parnika Khattri, a data enthusiast passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. With a Master’s in Business Analytics from Monash University, I blend technical expertise with business acumen to solve complex problems and drive data-driven decision-making.

## My Journey into Data

My fascination with data started with a simple question: How can we use numbers to tell stories? Over time, this curiosity led me to explore predictive modelling, data visualisation and automation, helping businesses make informed choices. From designing machine learning models to building interactive dashboards, I enjoy uncovering hidden patterns that create impact.
